# Amazon-Similar-Product-Apparel-Recommendation

Aimed to develop a Similar Apparel Recommendation System in
e-commerce. Used Amazon’sWomen FashionWear data to train
and developed ’Product Title’ based similarity models using techniques
like Bag ofWords,TF-IDF,word2vec,TF-IDF weighted
word2vec and finally CNN for ’Product Image’ based similarity as
well etc. Best results were observed for the last two techniques.
